# Flizzup Server

This repository contains the server-side code for Flizzup, an application originally built to make short-term rentals more accessible and affordable for Nigerians.
Flizzup was designed to function much like Airbnb but tailored to the Nigerian marketâ€”helping users easily discover and book affordable short-stay accommodations.
Although the Flizzup service has been shut down, this codebase has been made open-source to share the work behind it and support future learning or development by others.
